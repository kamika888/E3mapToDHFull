Rashid Ali, the Grand Mufti, and many members of the 'National Defence Government' fled to Persia, then went on to Germany. On the morning of 31 May, the Mayor of Baghdad and a delegation approached British forces at the Washash Bridge, offering surrender."

The response to the note was generally favourable, and in July 1936, 10 nations including the key interested parties such as UK and USSR have put their signatures on a new document which would last for decades. This document, among other things, significantly strengthened Turkish control of the straits, also giving Turkey the right to regulate and levy fees on ships passing through these strategic waterways, boosting its revenue from maritime traffic. For France and even more so for Britain, their accession to the treaty was a major concession to Turkey, which they felt obliged to make in order to prevent Turkey from joining the Axis."
