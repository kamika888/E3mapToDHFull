The German Reich was formally represented by a Reichsbevollmachtigter ('Reich Plenipotentiary'), i.e. a diplomat accredited to the Sovereign, a post awarded to Cecil von Renthe-Fink, the German ambassador, and then in November 1942 to the lawyer and SS general Werner Best. Meanwhile, Britain responded to the change in Denmark's status by sending a force to occupy Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. The Danish presense in Jutland was limited, and in 1942 Germans ordered the remnants of the Danish army to withdraw from Jutland after an incident involving a telegram communication between Hitler and King Christian."

The King replied with a simple 'Giving my best thanks. King Christian' sending the Fuhrer into a state of rage at this deliberate slight. In March 1943, Denmark held an election, in which the overwhelming majority of the voters supported anti-nazi parties. The election, discontent, and a growing feeling of optimism that Germany would soon be defeated led to widespread strikes and civil disturbances in the summer of 1943. The Danish government refused to deal with the situation to the satisfaction of the Germans, who responded with an ultimatum which the government felt unable to accept. The Danish government refused, so on 29 August 1943 the Germans officially dissolved the Danish government and instituted martial law. The Danish cabinet handed in its resignation, but since King Christian never officially accepted it, the government remained functioning de jure until the end of the war."

The speech was the first public admission by the National Socialist leadership that Germany faced serious dangers. Goebbels called for a total war to secure victory over the Allies, and exhorted the German people to continue the war even though it would be long and difficult, because, as he asserted, both Germany's survival and the survival of Western civilisation were at stake. Around the time of this speech, the government began to take first measures that would eventually lead to the all-out mobilisation of the German economy. Hitler, however, did not think the time was yet ripe for the kinds of extreme measures that Goebbels proposed, and wanted to keep things largely as they were for the time being. It took another year of constant military failure, and an assasination attempt on Hitler himself, before the Furher finally came to the conclusion that only a full-out total war effort could turn the tide. This was also a huge personal success for Goebbels, who told his staff that he had achieved 'practically full dictatorial powers' with the new appointment as the Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War."
