Meanwhile, for Moscow, its support for the Army of Anders was not entirely a waste. Aside from helping a common Allied cause of defeating the Axis, the USSR was also able to rid itself from the most troublesome Polish elements, to normalize relations with the average working Poles by presenting itself as a friend to Poland rather than a foe, and finally allowed for the creation of a brand new Polish army, one that would actually fight alongside the USSR."

Beria reported to Stalin anti-Soviet sentiments among the Polish soldiers, while the generals expressed their strong preference to leave the USSR and fight elsewhere. Repeated Soviet attempts to get the Polish divisions to assist the Soviet army in the pivotal battles of the Eastern Front were resolutely declined by the Polish leadership, and Stalin developed paranoia about a possible Polish rebellion in the middle of Siberia, akin to the Chechoslovak rebellion which sparked the bloody Russian Civil War 25 years prior. Ultimately, the Soviet leadership came to the conclusion that its funding of the Polish army on its territory was a dangerous waste of limited resources, and began to stiffle the aid, much to the dismay of the Polish generals. Finally, by agreement with the British goverment, the Polish army was evacuated from USSR through Iran to Africa, and later fought together with the British and Americans in Italy and in France. Meanwhile, for Moscow, its support for the Army of Anders was not entirely a waste. Aside from helping a common Allied cause of defeating the Axis, the USSR was also able to rid itself from the most troublesome Polish elements, to normalize relations with the average working Poles by presenting itself as a friend to Poland rather than a foe, and finally allowed for the creation of a brand new Polish army, one that would actually fight alongside the USSR."
