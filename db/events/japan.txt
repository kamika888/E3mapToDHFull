#  Marco Polo Bridge Incident (Japan, China)

	desc = "Japanese garrison troops in Feng-Tai, southwest of Beijing, clashed with Chinese forces at the Marco Polo Bridge following an incident involving a Japanese solder who had temporarily gone missing. The battle was at first limited to a local conflict and some hurried negotiations restored order. However, new incidents flared up soon after, and following a major Tongzhou mutiny which resulted in a massacare of Japanese and Korean civilians, the Japanese troops began offensive operations. Although the incidents themselves appear to have been accidental, Japan's frustration was real and growing every day. Japan's decision to escalate the conflict was the result of the gradual consolidation of China as well as the successful reconciliation between the two main Chinese parties - KMT and CCP. This all but guaranteed conflict between Japan and China, especially due to the hardline anti-Japanese position of the CCP and its sympathizers. The Chinese could not accept the loss of Manchuria and other Japanese gains since 1930 - they continued to provoke clashes, boycott Japanese products, and incite anti-Japanese uprisings. Under CCP's guidance, a whole 'Counter-Japanese Volunteer Army' was formed with the goal of driving Japan out of Northern China. Meanwhile, the Japanese took every opportunity to gradually expand their holdings, as an ever-expanding 'buffer' against the hostile Chinese polities. The rapprochement between the Communists and Nationalists convinced leadership in Tokyo that the status quo was no longer tenable. The choice now was to either fight or flee. Japan already fled from Russia in 1920s under similar circumstances, could it really afford to show such cowardice again, and miss its possibly last historical chance for greatness?"

The Japanese under General Tomoyuki Yamashita had advanced with approximately 30,000 men against at least 85,000 Allied troops dug in the heavily fortified island of Singapore, although many Allied troops were inexperienced and less than reliable. The Japanese managed to surprise the defenders establish a crossing where they were not expected. A week later, Singapore surrendered. After the battle, about 40,000 Indian soldiers, mostly conscripted, joined the pro-Japanese Indian National Army and later fought with the Japanese in the Burma campaign. Churchill called the defeat at Singapore the worst disaster in British military history."

Unable to convince Chiang of their position, Wang and his associates resigned from their positions and left Chongqing. In August, Wang secretly convened the 6th National Congress of the KMT in the city of Shanghai, effectively creating a new collaborationist Kuomintang with himself as the leader. To discredit the legitimacy of the Chongqing government, Wang adopted Sun Yat-sen's KMT flag in the hope that it would establish him as the rightful successor to Sun and bring the government back to Nanjing. During its existence, the Reorganized National Government nominally led a large army often called the 'Nanjing Army' that was estimated to have included 300,000 to 500,000 men, along with a smaller navy and air force. Although its land forces possessed limited armor and artillery, they were primarily an infantry force."

### Philippines
### Phi made a very weak puppet and for AI it's even worse because JAP AI will not garrison their beaches
### a total of maybe 10k fighters and 10k gendarmerie were raised. This is probably equivalent to the oversea occupied MP gain
##########################################

##########################################
### #Indonesia
### Indonesia raised a total of ~100,000k collaborators, from which about 60k PETA and 40k Heiho (gendarmerie), some sources give much greater figures.
### This is more than what would normally be gained through occupied overseas MP gain for Japan. However, there was no official puppet government
### There is the same problem with AI - Japan will not garrison the beaches of INO. Leave most beaches under Japanese control?
### For now, no independence route - just MP gain for japan
