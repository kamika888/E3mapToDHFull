It left much of our former territory under Polish rule, including many of our Ukrainian and Belorussian brothers. Even more importantly, it left the security of our country in a somewhat fragile state, with the Eastern polish border only 500km away from Moscow and even closer to Leningrad. If Germany were to take all of Poland, this would be an enormous security problem. While the pact we signed with Germany promises Eastern Poland to us, it is abundantly apparent that agreements reached with Hitler mean nothing unless they are backed up by force. For this reason alone, we must act, and act quickly."

By 1927, however, the room for recovery had largely been exhausted, the growth in defense spending and a series of economic crises forced the Soviet leadership to reconsider the continued utility of NEP. There were two competing schools of thought - one argued that NEP should be preserved, but adjusted in such a way as to expect lower rates of growth. The other school of thought argued that the Soviet Union could not afford to slow down its growth, especially while surrounded by potentially hostile capitalist powers, and that NEP should be abandoned in favor of a program of rapid forced industrialization by means of nationalisation, collectivisation, and ambitious five-year development goals. Stalin initially backed the supporters of NEP, but after 1927 he changed his mind and decided to support forced industrialization. In a speech before the 15th Congress of VKP(b), Stalin warned that without an end to economic backwardness 'the advanced countries...will crush us.' Thus, the VKP(b) approved the First Five-Year Plan, which served as the blueprint for future Soviet economic development for many decades."

	desc = "The First Five-Year Plan (1928-1933) led to mixed results. Areas like capital goods increased 158%, consumer goods increased by 87%, and total industrial output increased by 118%. Yet, these successes were still far below the goals initially outlined by the planning committee, and the cost to the Soviet people - particularly the peasantry, was very severe. The plan ended with a massive famine of 1932-1933 which claimed the lives of between 3.3 and 7.5 million people, and led to a serious slump in the the overall production, particularly in the agricultural sector. Despite this, the achievements of the first plan laid the foundation for the much more successuful Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1937), which saw an explosive growth in Soviet economic output. While much of the capitalist world was suffering from the Great Depression, the USSR instead saw overall GNP growth averages of 10% to 12% per year. But these achievements also did not come for free, they were only made possible by a forced labor system and an increasingly repressive state apparatus, which led directly to the massive purges of 1937-1938. Finally, the Third Five-Year Plan was adopted in the midst of rising tensions in Europe and focused mostly on the devlopment of war industries and a growth in defense spending. Industry grew at at a pace of 11% per year and overall GNP growth averaged at about 6% yearly growth. In 1941, the Third Five-Year plan was abandoned due to the outbreak of the war."

#	The Great Terror
#	Short term negative effects: lower GDE, much lower MAXORG, higher offensive&defensive vulnerability, removed hq divisions, purged officer corps
#	Short term negative effects gradually expire by 1942, a few officers will be reinstated as well
#	There will also be a temporary combat effectiveness hit at the start of the war, lasting from 1 to 6 months depending on how much purging was done
#	Positive effects: higher morale/fanaticism, better intelligence, one-time dissent reduction, economic growth events no longer cause dissent,
#	Start of war with Germany and mobilization gives considerably less dissent, GPW effects last longer (5 years instead of 1 year)

	desc = "Meanwhile, the Great Terror also had a practical goal - with the rise militant fascism across much of Europe and Asia, the remilitarization of Germany and growing border clashes against Japan, the spectre of a new global war grew ever closer. In this atmosphere, Stalin and most of the security apparatus felt that their immediate goal was to achieve total consolidation of the Soviet society in the face of the likely enemy. There was no more room for factionalism, criticism, underground 'opposition blocs', and constantly wavering loyalty of the old bolsheviks. And especially, there was no room for criticism of the draconian forced industrialization policies pushed by Gosplan. The Soviet people and above all the Party itself had to become fanatical, display unquestionable loyalty, and be ready for absolute sacrfice - this was the only way to ensure victory and avoid the repeat of 1917."

Thus, one of the NKVD chiefs explained his mission as follows: 'The USSR is already fighting against Japan, and soon it will be fighting against Germany. The government pins its hopes on the NKVD to cleanse the country of alien and unreliable elements [...] For this reason, we expect to execute no less than 5 million class enemies across the Union.' The terror started as a campaign targeting former Whites, kulaks, wealthy NEP-men, esers, liberals, members of the tsarist and provisional governments, and other 'class enemies'.
