However, he died on 20 July in a plane crash, while attempting to fly back to Spain. This left the revolt without a clear leader. A collective leadership body was then established, known as National Defense Junta, under the nominal leadership of Miguel Cabanellas, the most senior participating general. General Emilio Mola, the main 'Director' of the uprising and commander of the Nationalist forces in the north, was the second most prominent figure in the Junta. Francisco Franco was added to the council later in early August. The Junta immediately began bickering and was unable to set an overall strategy. Being career officers, all of the Junta members implicitly recognized that the army cannot be led by a collective leadership - there has to be a single leader of the armed forces, and a single future Caudillo of Spain. Thus, in September 1936, the Junta met to decide on a leader once and for all. Cabanellas was not favored for this role as he was too old, too moderate and a Freemason on top of that. Mola was a likelier candidate, but he was seen as too ruthless and radical, and his chief role as the planner of the coup earned him some derision as the coup effectively failed and degenerated into bloody civil war. Ultimately, Francisco Franco was chosen near-unanimously as a 'compromise candidate' who showed great promise as the leader of the Army of Africa, had little prior involvement in politics, good military credentials, and support from the Catholic Church."

	name = "The Republic chooses a leader"
	desc = "After the Popular Front victory in the February elections, the Republic went through a series of moderate-left minority governments, each one making successive attempts to reach a national consensus, restore order, and avoid a coup. Some lasted only 3 days in office, others just 1 day, and none were successful. The cabinet of Jose Giral lasted 47 days, but as the reality of the military uprising became an unavoidable fact and with the Republican forces suffering one setback after another, Jose Giral's government had no choice but to resign in order to make way for a broad-based coalition of left-wing parties supporting the Republic, including the Communists, Socialists, and Anarchists. The Popular Front coalition, which included a broad spectrum of leftist parties, called for a government that better represented the revolutionary zeal of the masses and could implement more decisive measures needed to transform Spanish society and win the war. In these circumstances, Francisco Largo Caballero, a charismatic socialist leader and former head of the General Union of Workers (UGT-PSOE), emerged as the key figure capable of uniting the leftist factions. Initially hailed as the 'Spanish Lenin', Caballero quickly formed a government that included all the chief left-wing parties. Thus, the civil war turned into the 'battle of two Franciscos'. One of the first contraversial decisions of the Caballero government was to transfer all of Spain's gold reserves outside the country - 75% to USSR and the remaining 25% to France. Caballero's candidacy was opposed by Prieto Tuero, another popular leader of the PSOE and a representative of its moderate wing, as well as Juan Negrin, another moderate, who nonetheless enjoyed very close ties to the USSR and the support of the local Communist Party."

Lluis Companys and his ERC, likewise, had little appetite for a second uprising against Madrid - after the first one thoroughly failed in 1934. Meanwhile, a new force of about 5,000 policemen departed from Madrid and Valencia towards Barcelona. Two Republican destroyers and the battleship Jaime I, coming from Valencia, reached the port of Barcelona on the same day. That night, Lluis Companys had a conversation with Caballero and accepted Madrid's 'offer of assistance' in restoring order. An inter-republican civil war was narrowly avoided. However, while the clashes soon stopped, the consequences of the events in Catalonia were far-reaching. One of the casualties was Trotskyist POUM, which was promptly outlawed at the insistence of USSR, and its leaders arrested. Another casualty was Francisco Caballero himself, who was accused of mishandling the Barcelona crisis. The Stalinists in particular also saw a good opportunity to scapegoat Caballero for all the frontline setbacks and economic failures. As a result, they pulled their support from the Caballero government, and the Prime Minister was forced to resign. His replacement, Juan Negrin, was from the same party as Caballero, but he was seen as a more moderate figure, and simultaneously even more beholden to the Soviets - who at this time preferred to place their bets on the moderates rather than radical revolutionaries."

While the Republicans struggled to find compromise between the Anarchists, Stalinists, Trotskyists, separatists, and moderate social democrats; on the Nationalist side, the divisions ran chiefly between the Militarists, Falangists, Carlists, Alfonists, and moderate conservatives. While the army led and headed the initial uprising, the Falangists and the Carlists together provided the overwhelming majority of volunteer militias, without which the uprising would have been doomed to fail. However, as the military-militia alliance carved out a zone of control particularly in northern Spain, the different factions immideately began to bicker over influence, political positions, and future direction of the new regime. The military itself was initially divided as well, but once Franco consolidated his control over the Army - he set about trying to force a similar unification on the other political factions as well. The process was long and painful, and as it turned out - while there were a lot points of convergence among the various movements, there was also plenty of divergence. Moreover, each faction was loath to set aside its political ambitions, even in cases where views were similar. The Falangist movement was the main challenge, due to its sudden skyrocketing popularity and the support it was receiving from Italy and Germany. Franco ended up adopting and coopting much of the Falangist rhetoric and symbols, but he also moderated many of its radical policies. He was cautious of the Falange's potential to destabilize his rule and was particularly wary of its syndicalist economic ideas and revolutionary zeal. By 1937, he was able to use the internal divisions within FE de la JONS to largely 'tame' and capture the Falangist movement and appoint himself as its effective leader. There remained another challenge, however - the Carlists. On religious and economic grounds, Franco was more sympathetic to the Carlists than to the Falange. However, there were still numerous points of disagreement, such as the Carlist demands for autonomy for certain Spanish regions, and their insistence on Monarchy - which was a personal challenge to Franco and to the Junta as a whole. Furthermore, the Carlists were effectively running an independent state in Navarre, their main base of support, and had a very loyal core of followers. Ultimately, after many months of tiresome negotiations, Franco produced a 'Unification Decree' - effectively an ultimatum, ordering both Falange and the Carlist Communion to dissolve and to merge into a single political party, headed by Franco himself."

	desc = "From the onset, both the Nationalist and Republican sides of the conflict were bitterly divided among several conflicting interest groups. While the Republicans struggled to find compromise between the Anarchists, Stalinists, Trotskyists, separatists, and moderate social democrats; on the Nationalist side, the divisions ran chiefly between the Militarists, Falangists, Carlists, Alfonists, and moderate conservatives. While the army led and headed the initial uprising, the Falangists and the Carlists together provided the overwhelming majority of volunteer militias, without which the uprising would have been doomed to fail. However, as the military-militia alliance carved out a zone of control particularly in northern Spain, the different factions immideately began to bicker over influence, political positions, and future direction of the new regime. The military itself was initially divided as well, but once Franco consolidated his control over the Army - he set about trying to force a similar unification on the other political factions as well. The process was long and painful, and as it turned out - while there were a lot points of convergence among the various movements, there was also plenty of divergence. Moreover, each faction was loath to set aside its political ambitions, even in cases where views were similar. The Falangist movement was the main challenge, due to its sudden skyrocketing popularity and the support it was receiving from Italy and Germany. Franco ended up adopting and coopting much of the Falangist rhetoric and symbols, but he also moderated many of its radical policies. He was cautious of the Falange's potential to destabilize his rule and was particularly wary of its syndicalist economic ideas and revolutionary zeal. By 1937, he was able to use the internal divisions within FE de la JONS to largely 'tame' and capture the Falangist movement and appoint himself as its effective leader. There remained another challenge, however - the Carlists. On religious and economic grounds, Franco was more sympathetic to the Carlists than to the Falange. However, there were still numerous points of disagreement, such as the Carlist demands for autonomy for certain Spanish regions, and their insistence on Monarchy - which was a personal challenge to Franco and to the Junta as a whole. Furthermore, the Carlists were effectively running an independent state in Navarre, their main base of support, and had a very loyal core of followers. Ultimately, after many months of tiresome negotiations, Franco produced a 'Unification Decree' - effectively an ultimatum, ordering both Falange and the Carlist Communion to dissolve and to merge into a single political party, headed by Franco himself."

There were some instances of riots and clashes, but on the whole, neither the Carlists nor the Falange, particularly their rank-and-file, had any appetite for an inter-Nationalist civil war. Many of the main Carlist and Falangist leaders were coopted or outright bought off, and included within the council of the new ruling party, named FET de la JONS. Most of the militias likewise fell in line, albeit will very little enthusiasm. The new mandated militia uniform was to combine the blue shirt of the Falange and the red cap of the Carlists. Most of the Alfonists and regular conservatives likewise joined Franco's new sole legal political movement."

The military and some politicians intended the coup as a first step towards opening peace negotiations with the Nationalists; for the Anarchists and Socialists the priority was to remove the Communists from power.
