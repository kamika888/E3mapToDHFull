Subsequent repairs succeeded and were eventually completed in March 1947, almost 10 years since the initial flooding."

Mao wrote in 1935: The Long March is a manifesto. It has proclaimed to the world that the Red Army is an army of heroes, while the imperialists and their running dogs, Chiang Kai-shek and his like, are impotent. It has proclaimed their utter failure to encircle, pursue, obstruct and intercept us. The Long March is also a propaganda force. It has announced to some 200 million people in eleven provinces that the road of the Red Army is their only road to liberation."

Their fortunes grew even brighter with the outbreak of full-scale war against Japan in 1937. For the most part, the CCP-affiliated units tried to avoid engaging in frontal battles against the Japanese and concentrated on guerilla warfare, which proved to be highly effective not only at disrupting the Japanese and their collaborators, but equally so at spreading the appeal of Communism in the Japanese-occupied territory as a natural antagonist to the reactionary Japanese ideology. The communists aggressively expanded their influence within the occupied territories by various means, from spreading Marxist propaganda to harassing rival rebel groups into submission. From the humble start of less than 100,000 foot soldiers in 1936, the Communist armies grew steadily over the course of the war, such that by 1945 they had more than 1.3 million men under arms, with a separate militia of over 2.6 million."

Meanwhile, Zhang Guotao's Fourth and He Long's Second Red Armies were still in Garze county, in Southwest China's Sichuan province. The terrain there was nearly inhospitable and the KMT attacks were relentless. Nevetheless, Zhang Guotao was a fiercely independent and ambitions leader, a rival of Mao Zedong, for a long time he was executing a separate strategy and trying to build his own revolutionary base. However, the combination of dire conditions in Garze, dwindling supplies, unsustainable casualties, intense pressure from the Comintern, and the insistence of 2nd Army's He Long, finally convinced Zhang to abandon Garze and	head north to join Mao in Shaanxi."

The CCP leadership, having grown confident of their increased strength, wanted to put it to good use and show it off to the world, establishing themselves as a major anti-Japanese fighting force. The offensive was a qualified success. While many of its initial gains were eventually reversed, the Japanese were humiliated and their plans were disrupted. As a side effect, Chiang grew even more weary and frightened of the CCP's growing strength."

Chiang accused CCP's Fourth Army in particular of establishing partisan bases in the Nanjing region, in Anhui and Jiangsu, and in doing so, violating the balance of power in China and defying the orders of the Military Commission regarding troop dispositions. During a heated argument with Zhou Enlai, Chiang declared that the CCP 'showed itself to be dishonorable, moved to another region, expanded its influence, increased its troops without permission, organized partisan detachments, and concentrated its troops around the troops of the central government.' To settle the issue, Chiang categorically demanded that CCP withdraw its forces north of Yellow River within a month. Under intense pressure, the CCP agreed to move its troops north of the Yangtze River, and regiments of the 4th Army under Ye Ting started to move towards Jiangsu, planning to cross the river along three routes. However, Chiang's frustration had already reached a boiling point, and he ordered the Communists to be surrounded and destroyed by an overwhelming force during their attempt to cross. After days of fighting, the 9000 strong Communit force was practically destroyed by the overwhelming numbers of Nationalist troops. Ye Ting, wanting to save his men, went to KMT's headquarters to negotiate terms, but he was simply detained upon arrival and threatened with execution. The incident led to effective breakdown of the United Front between CCP and KMT. Intense foreign pressure by the USSR and the US barely managed to avoid further escalation, but any further cooperation between CCP and KMT from that point was brought to a minimum. The incident also led to the winding down of Soviet aid to China and its gradual replacement with American aid."

His prediction proved to be correct - with the anti-Japanese feelings running rampant everywhere from the National Army to the peasantry, every move the CCP made directed against Japan hugely boosted its popularity and contrasted favorably with the passive appeasement policy followed by KMT. So much so, that many warlord units nominally under the KMT control flat out refused to fight the Communists. But to stay true to this path, the Communists had to make a bold move which would prove that their desire to confront Japan is sincere, and not just an empty propaganda ploy. To do this, in February 1936, Communist leaders Xu Haidong and Liu Zhidan led 34,000 Communist guerillas into southwestern Shanxi, which was ruled by a Nationalist-aligned warlord, Yan Xishan, and demanded that he let them through his territory so that they can reach Chahar, where the Anti-Japanese volunteer armies were being hard-pressed by Japan.

Aside from Mao's sincere belief that Japan was a growing danger to China which had to be confronted, he was also hoping to use the struggle against Japan as a way to boost the CCP's popularity and undermine the morale of the troops sent by KMT to destroy it. His prediction proved to be correct - with the anti-Japanese feelings running rampant everywhere from the National Army to the peasantry, every move the CCP made directed against Japan hugely boosted its popularity and contrasted very favorably with the passive appeasement policy followed by KMT. So much so, that many warlord units nominally under the KMT control flat out refused to fight the Communists. But to stay true to this path, the Communists had to make a bold move which would prove that their desire to confront Japan is sincere, and not just an empty propaganda ploy. To do this, in February 1936, Communist leaders Xu Haidong and Liu Zhidan led 34,000 Communist guerillas into southwestern Shanxi, which was ruled by a Nationalist-aligned warlord, Yan Xishan, and demanded that he let them through his territory so that they can reach Chahar, where the Anti-Japanese volunteer armies were being hard-pressed by Japan. Faced with a tough choice, Yan choose the option he saw as the lesser of two evils - to stick with his alliance with Nanjing and to confront the Communists. However, while the Shanxi forces were largely successful in stopping the Communist advance and inflicting casualties on them, the political gain made by the Communists was enourmous and they came back with many more new recruits than came in with. Liu Zhidan, however, did not make it, as he was martyred during the operation."

In 1941, the USSR signed a non-aggresion treaty with Japan, and the cross-border raids had to cease. In 1942 the USSR officially disbanded the NCJUA, and out of its remnants it formed the 88th Separate Rifle Brigade of the Soviet Army. The Brigade was stationed in the Far East and did not see combat on the German front, but in 1945 it finally saw action during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. After the end of the operation, the unit was disbanded and its veterans went on to join the Chinese Red Army and the Korean People's Army. Among the Korean members of the NCJUA was Kim Il Sung, the future leader of North Korea."
