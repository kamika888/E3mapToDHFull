	desc = "The Roosevelt administration is deeply opposed to any potential German victory in Europe and likewise Japanese victory in China, and considers them both to be antithetical to the US security and economic needs. From Roosevelt's perspective, the United States has a vital interest in preserving the balance of power and preventing the emergence of hegemonic rivals in both Europe and Asia. The best possible outcome is for Germany and Japan to get bogged down in endless wars with minimal direct US involvement. However, if either Germany or Japan get too close to victory - the US would have no choice but to intervene directly. But this will not be easy. Much of the American population consists of ethnic Germans, Italians, and Irish - many of whom are loath to see yet another US intervention on the side of the British, especially given that the last such intervention did not appear to bring much tangible benefit. In addition, support for the Allies is opposed by many veterans of WW1, right-wingers, religious groups and pacifist organizations, industrialists profiting from trade with the Axis powers, as well as ordinary citizens impoverished by the Great Depression and deeply worried about the economic cost of another war. We should expect any intervention on the side of the Allies to be rather unpopular. However, if we can provoke the Axis into making the first major move against us - then we can blunt the impact of popular opposition considerably."

The British, although desperate for help, initially refused this brazen offer.  But as the Battle of Britain intensified, Churchill managed to work out a deal with Roosevelt for an expanded list of US bases in exchange for destroyers to help deal with the German submarine threat, and Roosevelt pushed through the agreement despite opposition from Congress. The US received rights to about 23 different bases in the Western hemisphere, in return for the shipment of 50 destroyers to the UK. The destroyers were very old and in bad condition, and the resulting deal was so one-sided that Churchill's aide John Colville compared it to the USSR's proposals to Finland. Effectively, Britain ceded control over some of its Empire for the duration of the war to the US for safekeeping.

Deliveres were made via the Arctic Convoys, the Persian Corridor, and the Pacific Route. The Arctic route was the shortest and most direct route for lend-lease aid to the USSR, though it was also the most dangerous as it involved sailing past German-occupied Norway. Some 3,964,000 tons of goods were shipped by the Arctic route; 7% was lost, while 93% arrived safely. The Persian Corridor was the longest route, and was not fully operational until mid-1942. Thereafter it saw the passage of 4,160,000 tons of goods, 27% of the total.
